I started my profession in the 2000's as a Data Center technician and climbed the tech ladder step after step, spending my 20+ years career in IT switching between customer and vendor roles, mostly working with the VMware technology stack. I actively contributed to the users community as a VMware vEXPERT and a VMUG Italy Leader. I have been an active Tech Field Day delegate, writing about tech on my (now defunct) blog. I have progressively been "refactoring" myself from being an old-skool infrastructure geek into a cloud-native one (still WIP...). After some time as Technical Marketing Manager with Sysdig, I returned to a customer facing role with Veeam Kasten, where I am an Inside Sr. Systems Engineer covering EMEA customers. I live in Valencia, Spain with my wife and two cats.
