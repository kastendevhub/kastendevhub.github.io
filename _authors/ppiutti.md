I started my profession as a Data Center technician and climbed the tech ladder step after step, spending my 20+ years career in IT switching between customer and vendor roles. I actively contributed to the users community as a VMware vEXPERT, a VMUG Italy Leader and Tech Field Day delegate, writing about tech on my (defunct) blog. I have been "refactoring" myself from old-skool infrastructure geek to a cloud-native one. After some time as Technical Marketing Manager with Sysdig, I joined Veeam Kasten, where I am an Inside Sr. Systems Engineer covering EMEA customers. I live in Valencia, Spain with my wife and two cats.
